# Fuzzy-logistic-regression

The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
(1) A novel credit scoring ensemble model combining fuzzy logistic regression with fuzzy heterogeneous weighting effects, successfully addressing the class imbalance and data fuzziness issues while achieving good generalization and default sample recognition.
(2) A dynamic fuzzy heterogeneous weighting method designed to aggregate sub-model predictions, quantify the contribution of each base model and integrate their fuzzy characteristics to improve overall prediction accuracy.
(3) The proposed model offers significant interpretability advantages: each sub-model employs transparent fuzzy logistic regression, ensuring linear traceability and semantic interpretability. Additionally, SHAP's global-local attribution method effectively quantifies each feature's impact on default prediction.
